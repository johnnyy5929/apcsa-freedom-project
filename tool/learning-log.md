So I just started learning about these tools, so at first I went on the website to look around and watched videos. Afterwards, I started playing around with the tool.
I downloaded it to my computer and now:
I am making different shapes in both the 3D and 2D models.

So, for this week, I planned on tinkering with my tool more, so what I did was add more shapes and learned how to add words to the games. As we can see here:

So what I did was add words for both 2D and 3D models. So that is what I did for this week's Learning Log.
